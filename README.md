Objectives: <br>
Detect and Localize Animals:
Use a CNN-based object detection model to detect animals in wildlife images and videos, drawing bounding boxes around them. <br>
Improve Accuracy through Pre-trained Models:
Leverage transfer learning from pre-trained object detection models YOLO to improve accuracy. <br>
Evaluate Performance on Wildlife Data:
Use standard evaluation metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), precision, and recall for bounding box predictions. <br>
Deploy the Model for Real-Time Animal Detection in Videos:
Develop a system that can process video streams in real-time, identifying animals in each frame and tracking their movements. <br>
