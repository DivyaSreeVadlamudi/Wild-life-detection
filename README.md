## Objectives: <br>
1. Detect and Localize Animals. <br>
2. Use a CNN-based object detection model to detect animals in wildlife images , drawing bounding boxes around them. <br>
3. Improve Accuracy through Pre-trained Models. <br>
4. Leverage transfer learning from pre-trained object detection models YOLO to improve accuracy. <br>
## Evaluate Performance on Wildlife Data: <br>
Use standard evaluation metrics such as  precision, and recall for bounding box predictions. <br>

# Dataset Overview: <br>
## 1. Dataset Source <br>
    This dataset is available on Kaggle, contributed by Antoreep Jana. 
    It is publicly accessible and can be downloaded for educational and research purposes. 
    Link :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antoreepjana/animals-detection-images-dataset  
## 2. Dataset Composition <br>
    80 Unique Classes: Each class corresponds to a specific animal species or category.
    Class Selection: Due to the large size of the dataset, we have selected only 5 classes ('Cheetah', 'Fox', 'Jaguar', 'Lion', 'Tiger') for training. This decision was made to simplify the training process and reduce the computational resources required. By focusing on a smaller subset of classes, the model can be trained efficiently
    Images: Each subclass contains multiple images representing a particular animal. 
    Labels : Each subclass contains labels of their corresponding images.
