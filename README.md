## **Objectives:** <br>
1. Detect and Localize Animals. <br>
2. Use a CNN-based object detection model to detect animals in wildlife images and videos, drawing bounding boxes around them. <br>
3. Improve Accuracy through Pre-trained Models. <br>
4. Leverage transfer learning from pre-trained object detection models YOLO to improve accuracy. <br>
**## Evaluate Performance on Wildlife Data:**
Use standard evaluation metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), precision, and recall for bounding box predictions. <br>

## 2. Dataset Composition <br>
    80 Unique Classes: Each class corresponds to a specific animal species or category. <br>
    Images: Each subclass contains multiple images representing a particular animal. <br>
    Labels : Each subclass contains labels of their corresponding images. <br>
    Train-Test Split: The dataset is pre-split into training and testing subsets, each with 80 classes. <br>
